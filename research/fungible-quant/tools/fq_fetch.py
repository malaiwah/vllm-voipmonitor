"""fq_fetch — fetch only the expert fragments your recipe actually needs.

The consumer half of Progressive Tensors (peer review, finding 3).  The old
quickstart said `hf download <repo>`, which pulls the entire segment
repository — 347 GB for the GLM-5.2 K3 base — even when the recipe touches
eight layers.  Segments are per-expert contiguous and `index-kK.json` gives
every expert's byte span, so the right operation is an HTTP Range read of
exactly those spans.  That is what this tool does:

    recipe (fq-policy/2)  +  one or more source repos
      -> per-expert byte ranges, coalesced, verified, resumable
      -> a local segment tree that fq_assemble consumes unchanged

Nothing else about the pipeline changes: the output directory holds ordinary
`layer-LLL.kK.safetensors` files (a *subset* of experts each) plus a local
`index-kK.json`, so `fq_assemble.py --segments <out>` works as if you had
downloaded everything.

Multi-source, per-expert.  `--source` is repeatable and ordered: the first
source that carries an expert at the required K wins, unless overridden by
content hash (`--prefer-sha`, "give me this exact fragment, whoever has it")
or by an explicit provider map (`--select map.json`, per layer or per
expert).  One output segment file may therefore mix fragments from several
publishers — each verified against *its own* publisher's signed attestation,
each recorded in `fq-fetch-report.json`.  That is the community-fragment
selection model, working.

Trust.  Every attestation used is signature-checked against a fingerprint
pinned out of band (`--trust-signer`, resolved through keys/FINGERPRINTS in
the git repo — see ../TRUST.md), and every fetched expert's bytes are hashed
against the attested digest before the file is finalized.  When the source
publishes a signed `fq-release/1` manifest, one signature covers the index
and attestation files too, fq_fetch checks their digests against it, and it
refuses when the release and the attestation disagree about a fragment.

The plan itself is authenticated too (peer review, finding P1-4c).  Tensor
names, dtypes, shapes and offsets come from the remote segment's
safetensors header, and a ranged read of a header is just bytes the server
chose to send: hashing the payload afterwards proves the *bytes* are the
attested ones, not that they are the tensors the header claims.  A
publisher who rewrote a header could relabel gate_proj as up_proj, or F16
as I16, and the reconstructed file would still pass every digest check —
and then be signed as trustworthy.  So before anything plans from a header,
--header-trust decides how it is proven:

  auto      (default) use the signed `fragment.header_sha256` when the
            publisher provides one; otherwise verify the WHOLE fragment
            against the signed `fragment.sha256` and read the header out of
            those verified bytes.  Always authenticated, sometimes slow —
            the plan summary says which fragments need the full read and
            how many bytes that costs before any of it happens.
  attested  require the signed header digest; refuse rather than download.
  full      always verify the whole fragment.
  unsafe    plan from the unauthenticated ranged header (the old
            behaviour).  Prints a banner, and the emitted attestation says
            `header_authentication: NONE` so downstream can see it.

Whatever is used is recorded per parent fragment in the `derived-from`
attestation this tool emits, so the tree says exactly which authenticated
inputs its layout came from.

    # what would this cost?
    fq_fetch.py --policy recipe.json --out ./segments --dry-run \\
        --source malaiwah/GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ-segments@<commit>

    # fetch it, pinning the signer
    fq_fetch.py --policy recipe.json --out ./segments \\
        --source malaiwah/GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ-segments@<commit> \\
        --source willfalco/GLM-5.2-EXL3-TR3-3.36bpw-FQ@<commit> \\
        --trust-signer a58b7bb79ba58457

    # then, with the fingerprint fq_fetch prints for the subset it signed:
    fq_assemble.py --segments ./segments --source <checkpoint> \\
        --policy recipe.json --out ./my-checkpoint \\
        --trust-signer <your local fq_fetch fingerprint>

Why a second key.  A subset file is a NEW file — fewer experts, different
offsets, a different digest — so no publisher signature can cover it, even
though every expert byte in it was hashed against the publisher's signed
digest as it arrived.  fq_fetch therefore signs what it actually produced
with a local key (`--sign-key`, created on demand), as a `derived-from`
attestation naming the publisher fragments as parents and pinning them by
digest.  The publishers' own lines are kept under attestations/<source>/ so
the upstream hops stay checkable offline.  `--no-attest` skips this, and
then assembly needs `--insecure`.

Interrupt it and run it again: completed experts are recorded in
`state.json` and skipped, partial segment files are resumed in place.

HTTP: URLs and authentication come from `huggingface_hub` when it is
installed (so `hf auth login`, HF_ENDPOINT and private repos work); without
it the tool falls back to the public `/resolve/` URL shape and the HF_TOKEN
environment variable.  The ranged GETs themselves are plain urllib, so a
consumer needs no hub client at all.
