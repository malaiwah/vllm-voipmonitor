"""fq_release — one signed document per release, listing every file's sha256.

Why this exists (peer review, finding 5).  Today a consumer who wants to know
that a segment tree is the one the project published has to check N
independent `fq-attestation/1` signatures — one per layer per K, 152 of them
for GLM-5.2 — and each of those signatures only ever says "this fragment came
from that source shard".  Nothing says *which set of fragments is the
release*.  Fragments can be added, dropped, or rolled back to an older signed
version and every individual signature still verifies.

`fq-release/1` fixes the granularity: ONE ed25519 signature over a document
that names the release and lists sha256 + size for every file in it,
including `index-k*.json`, `fq-manifest.json` and every
`attestations/*.jsonl`.  A consumer then:

    1. verifies one signature against a fingerprint pinned out of band
       (keys/FINGERPRINTS in the git repo — see ../TRUST.md),
    2. hashes the files it actually downloaded and compares,

and is done.  Because the attestation files are themselves covered by that
one signature, their per-expert digests become trusted data — a range-fetch
consumer (fq_fetch) can hash a single expert's bytes against the attestation
without checking any further signatures.  The release manifest turns "N
signatures, unknown completeness" into "1 signature, explicit set".

    # publisher, in the segment tree
    fq_release.py build --dir ~/fq-segments/GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ \\
        --release "GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ k3 base 0.1.0" \\
        --repo malaiwah/GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ-segments

    # publisher, atomically, against a live repo
    fq_release.py publish --dir ~/fq-segments/GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ \\
        --release "GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ 0.1.0" \\
        --repo malaiwah/GLM-5.2-EXL3-FQ-segments

    # consumer, against a full or partial tree
    fq_release.py verify --dir ./segments \\
        --trust-signer a58b7bb79ba58457

Partial trees are first-class: `verify` reports how many listed files are
present and checks those, and only insists on completeness with --complete.
`--complete` is the strict rung: absent files AND unlisted files are both
failures, so "nothing was added and nothing was dropped" is a check you can
put in CI rather than a warning you have to read.

`publish` exists because `build` alone cannot make a release coherent on a
*remote* repo (finding P1-3).  A publisher that uploads file-by-file — the
default of every hub client, including our own campaign supervisor — leaves
the repository in a long succession of states that no signature describes,
and a second writer can interleave commits into the middle of one.  `publish`
therefore: reads the remote HEAD, builds and signs the release from the LOCAL
tree, and pushes every changed file plus `fq-release.json` as ONE
`create_commit` with `parent_commit=<the HEAD it read>`.  A concurrent writer
makes that push be *rejected* instead of silently interleaved; the retry loop
re-reads, rebuilds and re-attempts a bounded number of times.
